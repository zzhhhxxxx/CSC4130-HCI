## Assignment 1 : 

In this project, I design an interface that allows users to draw anything and erase what they have drawn through a mouse. Moreover, users can change line color and line width based on their preferences.


## Assignment 2 : 

In this project, I design an interface that allows users to 
- choose the shape type by a drop-down list, which contains three options: circle, rectangle, and
triangle;
- choose the color by a color menu;
- choose different opacity values to change the opacity of all shapes;
- use the mouse to draw three different shapes (i.e., circle, rectangle, and triangle) after clicking the “draw” button;
- use the mouse to select the drawn shapes and move them from one position to another after clicking the “move” button;
- remove all shapes after clicking the “reset” button.
